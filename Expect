**Subject:** Expectations Following Our Discussion

Dear [Manager's Name],

As per our recent discussion and your request, I am outlining my expectations below:

1. **Project Alignment**  
   The current project’s focus on analytics and the creation of decks for clients does not align with my long-term goals as a data engineer. My expertise lies in data processing, pipeline development, and technologies like Hive, Spark, and Hadoop. Given the limited scope for meaningful data engineering work, I would prefer not to continue on this project.

2. **Future Opportunities Within the Visa Account**  
   Even if I am moved to a different project within the Visa account, the ultimate focus still revolves around analytics and deck creation. This does not match my aspirations, which are centered on data engineering. I am looking for opportunities that involve large-scale data processing and pipeline development, which would allow me to better utilize my skills and continue growing professionally.

3. **Compensation**  
   I have received an offer from another company with a package of ₹23 LPA, out of which ₹22 LPA is fixed. If Clairvoyant can match this package and offer a role that aligns with my career objectives, I would be more than happy to continue here.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this and am open to further discussions.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
