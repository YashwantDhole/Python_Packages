**Subject:** Discussion Regarding My Resignation and Future Expectations

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for initiating a discussion around my resignation and to express my gratitude for the experience I’ve gained working with the team and our client, Visa.

However, as we discussed, there are certain expectations I have that would help me make an informed decision moving forward. Below are some key points I would like to outline:

1. **Project Alignment with Career Goals**  
   I was hired as a data engineer with expertise in technologies like Hive, Spark, and Hadoop, focusing primarily on batch and data processing. However, the current project’s focus is on analytics and generating decks for clients, which doesn’t align with my core interests or long-term career goals. There is limited scope for further Spark-related work, and the nature of the work revolves around reporting rather than building data pipelines, which is where my strengths lie. I would like to be part of projects that focus more on data engineering, pipeline development, and larger-scale data processing.

2. **Limited Learning and Growth Opportunities**  
   Currently, I am the only person working on this project, which limits collaboration and the potential for team learning. The absence of a dedicated team reduces opportunities for peer learning and skill enhancement, which is crucial for my professional growth. I also feel that there will come a time when all the possible migrations will be completed, leaving me with purely analytics-related tasks, which are not in line with my expertise or aspirations.

3. **Future Scope and Team Structure**  
   The work ahead in this project seems to be primarily centered on analytics after the remaining migrations are completed. Moving to other teams might not provide the right learning curve either, as the focus there will also likely be on similar outcomes. I would need reassurance that my role will evolve towards data engineering with clear opportunities to work on complex data processing challenges.

4. **Compensation**  
   Given the current scenario, I’ve already received an offer from another company, which aligns more closely with my professional goals. The offer I have is for ₹23 LPA, with ₹22 LPA being fixed. At Clairvoyant, my current package is ₹18.5 LPA, and I would need a significant adjustment in compensation to consider staying. I believe a competitive package that reflects my skills, market value, and the type of work I would be engaged in is important.

With these points in mind, I would like to understand if there are any possibilities within the organization for a role that better aligns with my goals and offers scope for growth in the data engineering domain, as well as adjustments in compensation.

Thank you once again for considering my thoughts. I’m happy to discuss this further and provide more context as needed.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
